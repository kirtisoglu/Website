I'm Alaittin – a fourth year Ph.D. student in [applied mathematics](https://www.iit.edu/applied-math) and a member of [Discrete Applied Math group](https://www.math.iit.edu/~kaul/DAM/DAM.html) 
at [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.edu/). Broadly speaking, my research interest lies in network design and combinatorial optimization.

PhD advisor: [Hemanshu Kaul]()


I've been lucky enough to work and do research at [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab)](https://www.fnal.gov/). (Project ?)

My broad background is characterized by three areas. First, the problem space: I want to understand how ... Second, the methods: I use novel computational methods that are able to make ... Third, the interventions: I design and test ... From soup-to-nuts I try to conduct rigorous, transparent science.


I completed my MSc at [Hacettepe University]() where I researched in graph theory under the supervision of [Lale Özkahya](https://ozkahya.github.io/). I was working as a full-time teaching 
assistant at [TED University](https://www.tedu.edu.tr/en) simultaneously.

MSc Advisor: [Lale Ozkahya]()
Master thesis and presentations


I did my undergrad at [Mustafa Kemal University](https://www.mku.edu.tr/default.aspx) in mathematics.
Those were the days I used to read poems, philosophy, travel a lot, and enjoy most.
I have spent every summer and winter breaks of six years in these fantastic places
